# tic-tac-toe
The Odin Project - Tic Tac Toe Exercise

A project made using factory functions. 

The main goal here is to have as little global code as possible. Wher ewe try tucking everything away inside of a module or factory. Rule of thumb: if only ONE of something is needed (gameBoard, displayController), use a module. If multiples are needed (players!), create them with factories.

Issues: add function to check if there is a winner
